### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm a Principal Front End Engineer at [Fundrise](https://www.fundrise.com).

Before that, I worked as a full-stack software engineer at [Dorsata](https://www.dorsata.com) and a UI/UX Software Engineer at [CCRi](https://www.ccri.com).

- ðŸ”­ Some of my side projects are [DidUVAWin.com](http://www.diduvawin.com), [OX Rush](https://ox-rush.herokuapp.com/), the [Washtenaw COVID data scraper](https://github.com/jdk2pq/washtenaw-covid-tracker/tree/master/data), and my attempts at the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning and building with Vue 3, Vite, and all the incredible tools from the Vue community, and I'm always trying something new with JS/TS.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m interested in working on projects that focus on healthcare, service, community outreach, and helping others.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the time I starred in a dramatic reenactment TV show on Discovery where I played one of a pair of star-crossed lovers and serial killers.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was named after the wrestler Jake "The Snake" Roberts, but I obviously didn't live up to his wrestling career.
