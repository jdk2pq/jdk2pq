### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a full-stack software engineer at [Dorsata](http://www.dorsata.com), where I help build an intuitive obstetrics platform focused on patient safety and integrating ACOG prenatal record best practices.

Previously, I worked as a UI/UX Software Engineer at [CCRi](http://www.ccri.com).

- ðŸ”­ Some of my side projects are [DidUVAWin.com](http://www.diduvawin.com), [OX Rush](https://ox-rush.herokuapp.com/), the [Washtenaw COVID data scraper](https://github.com/jdk2pq/washtenaw-covid-tracker/tree/master/data), and my attempts at the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Svelte, Snowpack, and improving my React skills.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m interested in working on projects that focus on healthcare, service, community outreach, and helping others.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the time I starred in a dramatic reenactment TV show on Discovery where I played one of a pair of star-crossed lovers and serial killers.
